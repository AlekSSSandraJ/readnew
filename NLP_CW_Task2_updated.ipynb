By 1953, he had refined this to the modern meaning. The field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the IEEE. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.\n",

Thus, the \"program\" is the optimal plan for action that is produced. For instance, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. Programming, in this sense, means finding an acceptable plan of action, an algorithm.\n",
              "Optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem. For example, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices, and then using this to pick the best overall path, as shown in Figure 1. In general, we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three-step process:\n",

              "To say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems. For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, F3 = F1 + F2 and F4 = F2 + F3 — computing each number involves computing F2. Because both F3 and F4 are needed to compute F5, a naive approach to computing F5 may end up computing F2 twice or more. This applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present: a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved.\n",
              "In order to avoid this, we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved. Then, if we need to solve the same problem later, we can retrieve and reuse our already-computed solution. This approach is called memoization (not memorization, although this term also fits). If we are sure we won't need a particular solution anymore, we can throw it away to save space. In some cases, we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we'll need in advance.\n",

The algorithm may be applied to any collection of entities with reciprocal quotations and references. The numerical weight that it assigns to any given element E is also called the PageRank of E and denoted by PR(E).\n",
              "The name \"PageRank\" is a trademark of Google, and the PageRank process has been patented (U.S. Patent 6,285,999 ). However, the patent is assigned to Stanford University and not to Google. Google has exclusive license rights on the patent from Stanford University. The university received 1.8 million shares in Google in exchange for use of the patent; the shares were sold in 2005 for $336 million.\n",
              "Google describes PageRank:\n",
              "“ \tPageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page's value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But, Google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; it also analyzes the page that casts the vote. Votes cast by pages that are themselves \"important\" weigh more heavily and help to make other pages \"important\". \t”\n",
              "In other words, a PageRank results from a \"ballot\" among all the other pages on the World Wide Web about how important a page is. A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support. The PageRank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and PageRank metric of all pages that link to it (\"incoming links\"). A page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself. If there are no links to a web page there is no support for that page.\n",
              "Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank denotes a site’s importance in the eyes of Google. The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.\n",
              "Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.\n",
              "Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.\n",

Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank denotes a site’s importance in the eyes of Google. The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. PageRank is a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided between all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes, called \"iterations\", through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value. A probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1. A 0.5 probability is commonly expressed as a \"50% chance\" of something happening. Hence, a PageRank of 0.5 means there is a 50% chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to the document with the 0.5 PageRank. The PageRank theory holds that even an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on links will eventually stop clicking. The probability, at any step, that the person will continue is a damping factor d. Various studies have tested different damping factors, but it is generally assumed that the damping factor will be set around 0.85. \n",

These sub-problems are only solved once and the solutions are saved so that they will not need to be recalculated again. Whilst calculated individually, they may also overlap. When any sub-problem is met again, it can be found and re-used to solve another problem. Since it searches all possibilities, it is also very accurate.

It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another. Each class groups together objects of a similar type, with similar properties. New classes can be formed by this process whose objects will have properties of both the classes from which this new class is formed. A superclass has all of the properties of the subclasses below it. At the same time subclasses are each distinctive from each other but related via the superclass. Subclasses are said to ‘extend’ superclasses. Due to these relationships, object oriented programmes tend to be easier to modify since they do not need to be changed when a new object, with different properties is added. Instead, a new object is made to inherit properties of objects which already exist. Inheritance can be divided into two main processes: single inheritance and multiple inheritance. Single inheritance means that the class can only inherit from one other class, whereas multiple inheritance allows for inheritance from several classes.\n",

The inheritance concept was invented in 1967 for Simula. The new classes, known as derived classes, take over (or inherit) attribute and behaviour of the pre-existing classes, which are referred to as base classes (or ancestor classes). It is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification. Inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages. Categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing, crucial to human learning by means of generalization (what is known about specific entities is applied to a wider group given a belongs relation can be established) and cognitive economy (less information needs to be stored about each specific entity, only its particularities). Inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. For instance, a \"fruit\" is a generalization of \"apple\", \"orange\", \"mango\" and many others. One can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple, orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit (i.e., an apple is-a fruit), apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant. An advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code, reducing the complexity of the program. Inheritance therefore has another view, a dual, called polymorphism, which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code. Inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding (replacing) one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor. \n",

Bayes' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes. It figures prominently in subjectivist or Bayesian approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic. It can be seen as a way of understanding how the probability that a theory is true is affected by a new piece of evidence. It has been used in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from marine biology to the development of \"Bayesian\" spam blockers for email systems. In the philosophy of science, it has been used to try to clarify the relationship between theory and evidence. Many insights in the philosophy of science involving confirmation, falsification, the relation between science and pseudosience, and other topics can be made more precise, and sometimes extended or corrected, by using Bayes' Theorem. Subjectivists, who maintain that rational belief is governed by the laws of probability, lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their models of empirical learning. Bayes' Theorem is central to these enterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of subjectivist position. Indeed, the Theorem's central insight  that a hypothesis is confirmed by any body of data that its truth renders probable  is the cornerstone of all subjectivist methodology. </td>\n",

The last two are somewhat easier to be dealt with (simply by being ignored most of the time). Link farms are groups of sites that are producing links between each other pursuing higher link counts. The reason for such manipulations is the pursuit of higher page rank so even higher number of users will see the page which will lead to higher income. Link farms can be exploited by joining to them and get inbound linkage but refuse to add links for ones own site to the sites from the link farm.

The method takes much less time than naive methods.\n",
              "The term was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another. By 1953, he had refined this to the modern meaning. The field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the IEEE. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.\n",
              "The word \"programming\" in \"dynamic programming\" has no particular connection to computer programming at all, and instead comes from the term \"mathematical programming\", a synonym for optimization. Thus, the \"program\" is the optimal plan for action that is produced. For instance, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. Programming, in this sense, means finding an acceptable plan of action, an algorithm.\n",
              "Optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem. For example, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices, and then using this to pick the best overall path, as shown in Figure 1. In general, we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three-step process:\n",
              "   1. Break the problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
              "   2. Solve these problems optimally using this three-step process recursively.\n",
              "   3. Use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem.\n",
              "The subproblems are, themselves, solved by dividing them into sub-subproblems, and so on, until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time.\n",
              "Figure 2. The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. That it is not a tree but a DAG indicates overlapping subproblems.\n",
              "To say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems. For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, F3 = F1 + F2 and F4 = F2 + F3 — computing each number involves computing F2. Because both F3 and F4 are needed to compute F5, a naive approach to computing F5 may end up computing F2 twice or more. This applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present: a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved.\n",
              "In order to avoid this, we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved. Then, if we need to solve the same problem later, we can retrieve and reuse our already-computed solution. This approach is called memoization (not memorization, although this term also fits). If we are sure we won't need a particular solution anymore, we can throw it away to save space. In some cases, we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we'll need in advance.\n",

In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B.

Votes cast by pages that are themselves \"important\" weigh more heavily and help to make other pages \"important\". \t”\n",

The PageRank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and PageRank metric of all pages that link to it (\"incoming links\"). A page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself. If there are no links to a web page there is no support for that page.\n",
              "Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank denotes a site’s importance in the eyes of Google. The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.\n",
              "Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.\n",

The method takes much less time than naive methods.\n",
              "The term was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another. By 1953, he had refined this to the modern meaning. The field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the IEEE. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.\n",
              "The word \"programming\" in \"dynamic programming\" has no particular connection to computer programming at all, and instead comes from the term \"mathematical programming\", a synonym for optimization. Thus, the \"program\" is the optimal plan for action that is produced. For instance, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. Programming, in this sense, means finding an acceptable plan of action, an algorithm.\n",
              "Optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem. For example, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices, and then using this to pick the best overall path, as shown in Figure 1. In general, we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three-step process:\n",
              "   1. Break the problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
              "   2. Solve these problems optimally using this three-step process recursively.\n",
              "   3. Use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem.\n",
              "The subproblems are, themselves, solved by dividing them into sub-subproblems, and so on, until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time.\n",
              "Figure 2. The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. That it is not a tree but a DAG indicates overlapping subproblems.\n",
              "To say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems. For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, F3 = F1 + F2 and F4 = F2 + F3 — computing each number involves computing F2. Because both F3 and F4 are needed to compute F5, a naive approach to computing F5 may end up computing F2 twice or more. This applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present: a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved.\n",
              "In order to avoid this, we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved. Then, if we need to solve the same problem later, we can retrieve and reuse our already-computed solution. This approach is called memoization (not memorization, although this term also fits). If we are sure we won't need a particular solution anymore, we can throw it away to save space. In some cases, we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we'll need in advance.\n",

It is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations. For example, a patient may be observed to have certain symptoms. Bayes' theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct, given that observation. (See example 2)\n",

However, it plays a central role in the debate around the foundations of statistics: frequentist and Bayesian interpretations disagree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications. Frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to their frequencies of occurrence or to subsets of populations as proportions of the whole, while Bayesians describe probabilities in terms of beliefs and degrees of uncertainty. The articles on Bayesian probability and frequentist probability discuss these debates in greater detail.\n",

The numerical weight that it assigns to any given element E is also called the PageRank of E and denoted by PR(E).\n",

However, the patent is assigned to Stanford University and not to Google. Google has exclusive license rights on the patent from Stanford University. The university received 1.8 million shares in Google in exchange for use of the patent; the shares were sold in 2005 for $336 million.\n",

              "“ \tPageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page's value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But, Google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; it also analyzes the page that casts the vote. Votes cast by pages that are themselves \"important\" weigh more heavily and help to make other pages \"important\". \t”\n",
              "In other words, a PageRank results from a \"ballot\" among all the other pages on the World Wide Web about how important a page is. A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support. The PageRank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and PageRank metric of all pages that link to it (\"incoming links\"). A page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself. If there are no links to a web page there is no support for that page.\n",
              "Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank denotes a site’s importance in the eyes of Google. The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.\n",
              "Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.\n",
              "Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.\n",

S can be estimated from search results, OR searches, or computed from inverted index data. We have evaluated SIDF values from commercial search engines by submitting queries relevant to the financial investment domain. Results compare favorably across search engines and queries. Our approach has practical applications for `real-world scenarios like in Web Mining, Homeland Security, and keyword-driven marketing research scenarios. \n",

Its applications include information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. With reference to this model, documents are represented as vectors. Each dimension corresponds to a separate term. The value of a vector is non-zero if a term occurs in the document.

Information Retrieval queries are also represented as vectors in the same vector space; these are then used in conjunction with the document vectors to find relevant documents. The two vectors are compared and the documents with a higher document-query similarity are ranked higher in terms of relevance. There are a variety of techniques that can be used to compare the two vectors; the most frequently used method for the vector space model is the Cosine Coefficient, which calculates the angle between the two vectors and produces a value between 0 and 1. \n",

It is used by the Google search engine to estimate the relative importance of a web page according to this weighting. The system uses probability distribution to determine the odds that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any given page. Following this, each web page is given a ranking of 0-10 according to its relevance to a search. The PageRank is calculated by taking into consideration the number of inbound links, and the PageRank of the pages supplying these links. This means therefore that if a webpage is linked to others that have a high ranking, then it too will receive a high rank. \n",

Outbound, links from your page to others.  Dangling, links to a page which has no links to others.  Deep, links to a specific page, usually bypassing the homepage.  The page rank algorithm takes the probability of a random surfer becoming bored and requesting another random page (otherwise known as the dampening factor) away from 1 and divides this number by the number of pages in the system, adding it to the dampening factor multiplied by the page rank of a linked page divided by the number of outbound links on that linked page.  Adding on this last section for every other page linked to from the original page.  Google uses this algorithm to assist intentional surfers in finding the best websites to suit their needs.  One of the problems with this popularity algorithm is that it is easily manipulated and can give false values, hence the frequent recalculating of page ranks.\n",

Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank denotes a site’s importance in the eyes of Google. The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. PageRank is a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided between all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes, called \"iterations\", through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value. A probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1. A 0.5 probability is commonly expressed as a \"50% chance\" of something happening. Hence, a PageRank of 0.5 means there is a 50% chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to the document with the 0.5 PageRank. The PageRank theory holds that even an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on links will eventually stop clicking. The probability, at any step, that the person will continue is a damping factor d. Various studies have tested different damping factors, but it is generally assumed that the damping factor will be set around 0.85. \n",

It uses a so called ‘bottom-up’ approach, meaning that the problem is solved as a set of sub-problems which in turn are made up of sub-sub-problems.Sub-problems are then selected and used to solve the overall problem. These sub-problems are only solved once and the solutions are saved so that they will not need to be recalculated again. Whilst calculated individually, they may also overlap. When any sub-problem is met again, it can be found and re-used to solve another problem. Since it searches all possibilities, it is also very accurate. This method is far more efficient than recalculating and therefore considerably reduces computation. It is widely used in computer science and can be applied for example, to compress data in high density bar codes.\n",

PageRank, along with similar algorithms developed by Google’s competitors for their search engines, is part of the second generation of technologies designed to rate the importance of web pages: the first, which was solely based on keywords in the page content and meta-data, could easily be influenced by those wishing to obtain a higher ranking for their less-relevant pages.\n",
              "\n",
              "The different with PageRank is that it tries to determine a web page’s relevance to users by attempting to determine its importance.  It does this by assigning it a value of importance that is dependant upon the number of web sites that link to that page, taking into account the importance value, or PageRank, of those pages.  The PageRank is computed iteratively, and it is found that the PageRank values converge fairly rapidly.\n",
              "\n",
              "Although it is much better than simple keyword-based ranking algorithms, PageRank is not infallible: we have an internet where advertising revenue can make up most - and quite frequently all – of a web site’s income and the people that run these web sites will always be trying to trick the system into giving their pages a higher PageRank.   One of Google’s attempts to counter this is their Google Toolbar browser plugin.\n",

              "Google Toolbar is a free tool which provides a number of useful functions in a convenient location: the users web browser window.  Google’s payoff is that it gets to track the behaviour of actual users.  This allows them to see whether their PageRank algorithm is accurate in assigning high PageRank values to the most relevant web pages and, just as importantly, low values to those that are irrelevant and try to fool the system. \n",

Inheritance is a process in object oriented programming in which objects acquire (or inherit) the properties of objects of another class. It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another. Each class groups together objects of a similar type, with similar properties. New classes can be formed by this process whose objects will have properties of both the classes from which this new class is formed. A superclass has all of the properties of the subclasses below it. At the same time subclasses are each distinctive from each other but related via the superclass. Subclasses are said to ‘extend’ superclasses. Due to these relationships, object oriented programmes tend to be easier to modify since they do not need to be changed when a new object, with different properties is added. Instead, a new object is made to inherit properties of objects which already exist. Inheritance can be divided into two main processes: single inheritance and multiple inheritance. Single inheritance means that the class can only inherit from one other class, whereas multiple inheritance allows for inheritance from several classes.\n",

Its objective is to add more detail to pre-existing classes whilst still allowing the methods and variables of these classes to be reused.

              "The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes become.  An example here would be books.  Books generally fall into two categories, fiction and non-fiction.  Each of these can then be sub-divided into more groups.  Fiction for example can be split into fantasy, horror, romance and many more.  Non-fiction splits the same way into other topics such as history, geography, cooking etc.  History of course can be sub-divided into time periods like the Romans, the Elizabethans, the World Wars and so on.\n",

It is valid in all common interpretations of probability. It plays a central role in the debate around the foundations of statistics: frequentist and Bayesian interpretations disagree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications. Frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to their frequencies of occurrence or to subsets of populations as proportions of the whole, while Bayesians describe probabilities in terms of beliefs and degrees of uncertainty. Applications of Bayes' theorem often assume the philosophy underlying Bayesian probability that uncertainty and degrees of belief can be measured as probabilities. One of Bayes' results (Proposition 5) gives a simple description of conditional probability, and shows that it can be expressed independently of the order in which things occur:\n",
              "If there be two subsequent events, the probability of the second b/N and the probability of both together P/N, and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened, from hence I guess that the first event has also happened, the probability I am right [i.e., the conditional probability of the first event being true given that the second has also happened] is P/b. \n",
              "Note that the expression says nothing about the order in which the events occurred; it measures correlation, not causation.\n",

              "      <td id=\"T_5b7ac_row47_col1\" class=\"data row47 col1\" >In mathematics and computer science, dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping sub problems and optimal substructure. The term was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another. By 1953, he had refined this to the modern meaning. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form. The word \"programming\" in \"dynamic programming\" has no particular connection to computer programming at all, and instead comes from the term \"mathematical programming\", a synonym for optimization. Thus, the \"program\" is the optimal plan for action that is produced. For instance, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. Programming, in this sense, means finding an acceptable plan of action, an algorithm.\n",
              "Dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches, the top-down approach, the problem is broken into sub problems, and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered, in case they need to be solved again. This is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom-up approach, all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems. This approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls, but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem.\n",
              "Some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name. Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. Scheme, Common Lisp or Perl), some need special extensions.This is only possible for a referentially transparent function.\n",

This is highly used in dynamic programming. The advantage being the less time consumption in comparison to other amateur methods.\n",
              "It has to be kept in mind that the term programming in the field has got nothing to do with computer programming at all. On the other hand it is derived from the term mathematical programming which is a similar word used for optimization. Here by meaning that a program can be an optimal plan for the produced action. The typical example could be of a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition. This leads to the concept of programming being a helper in finding an acceptable plan of action, which can also be termed as an algorithm\n",

Example could be of Fibonacci sequence; F3 = F1 + F2 and F4 = F2 + F3  computing each number involves computing F2. Because both F3 and F4 are needed to compute F5, a naive approach to computing F5 may end up computing F2 twice or more. It means that whenever we encounter with  overlapping subproblems, a naive approach may waste to,e recomputing optimal solutions to the already solved subproblems.\n",

By 1953, he had refined this to the modern meaning. The field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the IEEE. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programmer, which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.\n",

Therefore, the \"program\" is the optimal plan for action that is produced. For example, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. \n",
              "Optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem. For instance, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. After this, it is using this to pick the best overall path. In a word, we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three-step process.\n",

              "      <td id=\"T_5b7ac_row57_col1\" class=\"data row57 col1\" >In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a way to form new classes (instances of which are called objects) using classes that have already been defined. The inheritance concept was invented in 1967 for Simula. The new classes, known as derived classes, take over (or inherit) attribute and behaviour of the pre-existing classes, which are referred to as base classes (or ancestor classes). It is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification. Inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages. Categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing, crucial to human learning by means of generalization (what is known about specific entities is applied to a wider group given a belongs relation can be established) and cognitive economy (less information needs to be stored about each specific entity, only its particularities). Inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. For instance, a \"fruit\" is a generalization of \"apple\", \"orange\", \"mango\" and many others. One can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple, orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit (i.e., an apple is-a fruit), apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant. An advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code, reducing the complexity of the program. Inheritance therefore has another view, a dual, called polymorphism, which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code. Inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding (replacing) one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor. \n",

Bayes' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes. It figures prominently in subjectivist or Bayesian approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic. It can be seen as a way of understanding how the probability that a theory is true is affected by a new piece of evidence. It has been used in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from marine biology to the development of \"Bayesian\" spam blockers for email systems. In the philosophy of science, it has been used to try to clarify the relationship between theory and evidence. Many insights in the philosophy of science involving confirmation, falsification, the relation between science and pseudosience, and other topics can be made more precise, and sometimes extended or corrected, by using Bayes' Theorem. Subjectivists, who maintain that rational belief is governed by the laws of probability, lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their models of empirical learning. Bayes' Theorem is central to these enterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of subjectivist position. Indeed, the Theorem's central insight  that a hypothesis is confirmed by any body of data that its truth renders probable  is the cornerstone of all subjectivist methodology. </td>\n",

The criteria may include numbers of word matches with the search terms, number of other webpages that link this one and/or cite it as a source, number of unique visits for certain amount of time etc. There are some techniques that try to fool the search engines like link farms, keyword spamming and a lot of meta tags. The last two are somewhat easier to be dealt with (simply by being ignored most of the time). Link farms are groups of sites that are producing links between each other pursuing higher link counts. The reason for such manipulations is the pursuit of higher page rank so even higher number of users will see the page which will lead to higher income. Link farms can be exploited by joining to them and get inbound linkage but refuse to add links for ones own site to the sites from the link farm. Googles toolbar tries to follow the intentional user model by counting the visits from actual users (i.e. not computer bots) to a website. Page ranks can be calculated either recursively or iteratively. One of the most important uses of page rank is its meaning to advertising.\n",

              "      <td id=\"T_5b7ac_row67_col1\" class=\"data row67 col1\" >Inheritance is a method of forming new classes using predefined classes. The new classes are called derived classes and they inherit the behaviours and attributes of the base classes. It was intended to allow existing code to be used again with minimal or no alteration. It also offers support for representation by categorization in computer languages; this is a powerful mechanism of information processing, vital to human learning by means of generalization and cognitive economy. Inheritance is occasionally referred to as generalization due to the fact that is-a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. Inheritance has the advantage of reducing the complexity of a program since modules with very similar interfaces can share lots of code. Due to this, inheritance has another view called polymorphism, where many sections of code are being controlled by some shared control code. Inheritance is normally achieved by overriding one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by creating new methods on top of those exposed by an ancestor. Inheritance has a variety of uses. Each different use focuses on different properties, for example the external behaviour of objects, internal structure of an object, inheritance hierarchy structure, or software engineering properties of inheritance. Occasionally it is advantageous to differentiate between these uses, as it is not necessarily noticeable from context. \n",

              "The word \"programming\" in \"dynamic programming\" has no particular connection to computer programming at all, and instead comes from the term \"mathematical programming\", a synonym for optimization. Thus, the \"program\" is the optimal plan for action that is produced. For instance, a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program. Programming, in this sense, means finding an acceptable plan of action, an algorithm.\n",
              "Optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem. For example, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices, and then using this to pick the best overall path.\n",

              "Inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages. Categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing, crucial to human learning by means of generalization and cognitive economy (less information needs to be stored about each specific entity, only its particularities).\n",
              "The new classes, known as derived classes, take over (or inherit) attributes and behavior of the pre-existing classes, which are referred to as base classes (or ancestor classes). It is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification.\n",
              "Inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. For instance, a \"fruit\" is a generalization of \"apple\", \"orange\", \"mango\" and many others. One can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple, orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit (i.e., an apple is-a fruit), apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant.\n",
              "An advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code, reducing the complexity of the program. Inheritance therefore has another view, a dual, called polymorphism, which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code.\n",
              "Inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding (replacing) one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor.\n",
              "Complex inheritance, or inheritance used within a design that is not sufficiently mature, may lead to the Yo-yo problem.\n",

Given the probability of event A given event B, Bayes Theorem can be used to calculate the probability of B given A.  This is achieved using the conditional probability of B given A and the prior probabilities of both events A and B. For example: suppose there is a bag of coloured balls with 25 red ones and 75 black ones. Lucky Joe likes to predict the colour of the ball he selects and he is 80% accurate. Joe records all of his results and about 0.5% of the time he accidently records the wrong results. Using all of this information more probabilities can be inferred, including using Bayes Theorem to calculate various probabilities like Joe recording correctly if he guesses correctly or Joe recording incorrectly when his guess was correct (and other like combinations). \n",

When the problem is split into subproblems, these themselves may be split into smaller problems, and so on, until they cannot be reduced any more.\n",
              "It is also common for dynamic programming to make use of recursion, and the saving of previous results for faster computation later; this also leads to higher efficiency, as calculations are not being redone. For example, when a problem is reduced into sub problems, and those are then reduced further, it may be that there are common subsubproblems, and so only one calculation needs to be done and the result saved to help solve more than one subproblem.\n",
              "An example of this gain in efficiency is a path-finding problem. If there are two distinct routes in a network of 10 nodes, tagged A to J, then if the two routes share a common section (say, between nodes B and D), the cost of that section should be calculated for the first route and saved. Then, when the second route is being processed, the cost of B to D does not need to be calculated again.\n",
              "In general, dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems, where the most efficient solution is needed. Areas where this sort of programming is useful is in AI, computer graphics, compression routines, and biomedical applications.</td>\n",

The hierarchy that is formed is also useful for the organisation of classes and objects, as it defines a relationship between the child and the parent (the child class is a kind of the parent class). Inheritance is useful for situations where several classes share common features, such as needed functions or data variables. In addition to this, child classes can be referenced in terms of their parent classes, which can be useful when storing large data structures of objects of several classes, which can all be referenced as one base class. Inheritance is a core aspect of object-oriented programming, and is available in some form or another in most, if not all, object oriented languages available today. Most of these languages provide an extend keyword, which is used to subclass another. Also, the functions and data variables that are inherited by the subclasses can be controlled through the use of visibility modifiers.</td>\n",
